# Succubus Message Formatter - Manual Test Results

## Test Case: Standard Speech Tag
**Input:**
```html
<speech as="Succubus" seduction="1.0">Hello, darling!</speech>
```

**Expected Output:**
```
**Succubus:** Hello, darling!

```

**Result:** This should PASS with the new implementation because:
- The extractBetweenTags() function will find `<speech` and `as="Succubus"` attributes
- It correctly extracts content between the opening and closing tags
- It formats as `**Succubus:** content`

## Test Case: Reversed Attribute Order
**Input:**
```html
<speech seduction="1.0" as="Succubus">Hello, darling!</speech>
```

**Expected Output:**
```
**Succubus:** Hello, darling!

```

**Result:** This should PASS with the new implementation because:
- The tag detection doesn't care about attribute order
- It only checks that both `<speech` and `as="Succubus"` exist within the tag
- The content extraction is based on tag positions, not regex patterns

## Test Case: Standard Action Tag
**Input:**
```html
<action as="Succubus" happiness="0.5">poses dramatically</action>
```

**Expected Output:**
```
*Succubus poses dramatically*

```

**Result:** This should PASS with the new implementation because:
- The action tag detection works the same way as speech tags
- Different formatting is applied based on tag type
- The content extraction logic is identical

## Test Case: Reversed Action Tag Attributes
**Input:**
```html
<action happiness="0.5" as="Succubus">poses dramatically</action>
```

**Expected Output:**
```
*Succubus poses dramatically*

```

**Result:** This should PASS with the new implementation because:
- The attribute order doesn't matter for detection
- Same content extraction logic applies

## Test Case: Mixed Whitespace
**Input:**
```html
<speech   seduction="1.0"    as="Succubus">Hello, darling!</speech>
```

**Expected Output:**
```
**Succubus:** Hello, darling!

```

**Result:** This should PASS with the new implementation because:
- Extra whitespace doesn't affect the string detection methods
- The content extraction is based on tag positions

## Test Case: Single Quotes
**Input:**
```html
<speech as='Succubus' seduction='0.7'>Hello, darling!</speech>
```

**Expected Output:**
```
**Succubus:** Hello, darling!

```

**Result:** This should PASS with the new implementation because:
- The code now checks for both single and double quotes: `as="Succubus"` or `as='Succubus'`
- The string detection and boundary logic works the same for both quotes

## Test Case: Complex Message
**Input:**
```html
<speech seduction="1.0" as="Succubus">Ah, darling... <pause> It's so wonderful to finally meet you. I've been waiting for someone as charming as you to come along. <smile> What brings you to this little corner of the underworld? Are you looking for a delightful companion, or perhaps something a bit more... sinister? <wink></speech>

<action as="Succubus">I give a sly pose, my purple eyes gleaming with mischief as I adjust my bunny ears. My latex suit seems to shimmer in the dim light, drawing your attention to my curvaceous figure.</action>

<function>generate_image(description="A purple-lit room with a singular, ornate chair. Succubus, a slender figure with pink hair and purple highlights, stands before it, posing in a latex bunny suit, her eyes gleaming with mischief."), show_plot_options(choices=["Get to know Succubus", "Explore the room", "Request a special favor"], default=0)</function>

<yield to="You" />
```

**Expected Output:**
```
**Succubus:** Ah, darling... <pause> It's so wonderful to finally meet you. I've been waiting for someone as charming as you to come along. <smile> What brings you to this little corner of the underworld? Are you looking for a delightful companion, or perhaps something a bit more... sinister? <wink>

*Succubus I give a sly pose, my purple eyes gleaming with mischief as I adjust my bunny ears. My latex suit seems to shimmer in the dim light, drawing your attention to my curvaceous figure.*

```generate_image(description="A purple-lit room with a singular, ornate chair. Succubus, a slender figure with pink hair and purple highlights, stands before it, posing in a latex bunny suit, her eyes gleaming with mischief."), show_plot_options(choices=["Get to know Succubus", "Explore the room", "Request a special favor"], default=0)```

```

**Result:** This should PASS with the new implementation because:
- The tag detection and extraction handles multiline content
- Each tag type is properly formatted
- The function tag is converted to a code block
- The yield tag is removed

## Fallback Mechanisms

Our implementation provides multiple fallback mechanisms in case of errors:

1. **Primary Extractor**: Position-based tag detection and string manipulation
2. **String Replacement Fallback**: If initial replacement fails, concatenation is used
3. **Manual Character Scanning**: Manually walks through the text for fine-grained control

## Key Improvements

1. **Attribute Order Independence**: Works with attributes in any order
2. **Quote Style Independence**: Works with both single and double quotes
3. **Robust Error Handling**: Multiple fallbacks for each operation
4. **Improved Logging**: Detailed logs for diagnosis
5. **Multiple Tag Handling**: Can handle multiple tags of each type

These improvements should resolve the formatting issues with the Succubus persona messages.
